Have fun.

So, what is CTF?

**CTFs** are computer security/hacking competitions which generally consist of participants breaking, investigating, reverse engineering and doing anything they can do to reach the end goal, a "flag" which is usually found as a string of text.

**Example**
A very simple type of CTF challenge consists of looking at the source code of website or programs to find flags and/or hints. For example, can you find the flag hidden on this page?
